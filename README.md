## Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

1. Look for `Parking Gent` in HACS integrations
2. If not found, add as custom repository: `stijnpiron/parking_gent`
3. Install the integration
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Add integration via UI: **Configuration** ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí **Add Integration** ‚Üí **Parking Gent**

### Manual Installation
1. Copy the `custom_components/parking_gent` directory to your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder
2. Restart Home Assistant  
3. Add integration via UI: **Configuration** ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí **Add Integration** ‚Üí **Parking Gent**

## Configuration

### UI Setup (Recommended)
1. Go to **Configuration** ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí **Add Integration**
2. Search for **Parking Gent** and select it
3. Enter an integration name
4. Select which parking locations you want to monitor
5. Click **Submit** - sensors will be created for your selected parkings

### Changing Parking Selection
1. Go to **Configuration** ‚Üí **Integrations**
2. Find **Parking Gent** and click **Configure**  
3. Modify your parking selection
4. Click **Submit** - changes apply immediately

### Legacy Configuration (Deprecated)
For backward compatibility, the old `configuration.yaml` method still works:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: parking_gent
```

*Note: This method monitors all available parkings and doesn't provide selection options.*

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Logging
If you experience issues, enable debug logging:

1. Go to **Configuration** ‚Üí **Logs**
2. Set level for `custom_components.parking_gent` to **Debug**
3. Check logs for detailed API and processing information

### Common Issues
- **No sensors created**: Ensure at least one parking location is selected during setup
- **Sensors show unavailable**: Check if the parking location is currently open
- **Integration won't load**: Check debug logs for API connectivity issues

## API Status Check
The integration includes API health monitoring. Check the logs for current API status or run the test script in the `tests/` directory.

## Examples
- [Plotting the sensors on a map](documentation/custom_map-card.md)
- [Navigating via a script to the selected parking](documentation/navigate_to_parking.md)
